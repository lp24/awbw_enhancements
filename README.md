# AWBW Enhancements (Fork)

> **Note:** This is a fork of the original [AWBW Enhancements](https://github.com/kbuzsaki/awbw_enhancements) by [kbuzsaki](https://github.com/kbuzsaki). All credit for the original extension goes to the original author.

Forked again :D 1st fork by carsonhu, credit goes to the original authors. Code open-source, no profit is being made. 

"AWBW Enhancements" is a browser extension that adds extra functionality to [Advance Wars By Web](https://awbw.amarriner.com).

## Installation

The original extension can be installed for Chrome and Microsoft Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers) [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awbw-helper/cnkhdcnafdfffpkbbbeghbdjkabhbkfi) and for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awbw-enhancements/).

To use this fork, you'll need to load it as an unpacked extension.

> **⚠️ Important:** If you have the original AWBW Enhancements extension installed, you must **disable or remove it first** to avoid conflicts.

### Chrome / Edge / Brave (Chromium)

1. **Download the code:** Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. **Open Extensions page:** Go to `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`).
3. **Enable Developer Mode:** Toggle the "Developer mode" switch.
4. **Load Unpacked:** Click "Load unpacked".
5. **Select Folder:** Select the folder containing `manifest.json`.

### Firefox

1. **Download the code:** Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. **Prepare Manifest:**
   - Delete or rename the existing `manifest.json` (this is the Chrome version).
   - Rename `manifest_firefox.json` to `manifest.json`.
3. **Open Debugging page:** Go to `about:debugging`.
4. **Load Add-on:** Click "This Firefox", then "Load Temporary Add-on...".
5. **Select Manifest:** Select the `manifest.json` file you just renamed.

The extension should now be installed and active.

### Development (Firefox)

To avoid reinstalling the temporary extension every time you restart Firefox, you can use the `run-ff` command. This uses `web-ext` to launch a dedicated Firefox instance with the extension installed.

1.  Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
2.  Run:
    ```powershell
    ./manage.ps1 run-ff
    ```

**Base Units:**

**Additional units** (Mech, Md. Tank, Neotank, APC, etc) can have custom hotkeys assigned in the move planner.

All hotkeys are fully customizable in the move planner. A "Disable All Quick Action Hotkeys" button is available in the extension options in case you only want the bug fixes and CO portrait / army color fixes.

### Weather Toggle
This fork adds a weather toggle to the move planner that allows you to toggle weather between Clear, Rain, and Snow. This does not change the visuals much, but it does affect unit movement ranges.

### Tree-based Save/Load Snapshot System
This fork introduces a robust tree-based system for managing snapshots. You can now:
- **Save Tree**: Download the entire tree of snapshots to a file.
- **Load Tree**: Load a previously saved tree to resume analysis.
- **Branching**: Create multiple branches of play to explore different strategies.

### Automatic Unit Repair
Units on properties that provide repairs (Cities, Bases, Ports, Airports) are now automatically repaired at the start of the turn, simulating the actual game mechanics.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed CO portraits in move planner** - CO portraits were not being displayed in the move planner.
- **Added in support for new armies** - Extension now works for newly added armies in Advance Wars by Web.
- **Pre-deployed unit HP icons** - Fixed broken HP icon sprites appearing on pre-deployed units with full HP after savestate restore.
- **Ghost Production Fix** - Fixed a move planner bug where funds were deducted even if a unit wasn't built.
- **Hachi COP/SCOP Fix** - Hachi's COP and SCOP now correctly reduce unit costs.

## Original Features

The original extension includes:

1. Configurable keyboard shortcuts for replays.
2. Several quality of life improvements to the move planner ("Moveplanner Plus"), including:
    1. Movement range previews for the selected unit.
    2. Savestate "quick save" snapshots that let you snapshot and restore states without having to download a full savestate file.
    3. Automatic tracking of unit count, unit value, income, and funds in per-player panels, like on the game screen. This includes automatically deducting funds for unit builds and simulating income for future turns.
    4. Configurable opacity for the "action menu" and "build menu".
    5. Configurable keyboard shortcuts for toggling the damage calculator.
3. Fixes for certain bugs in the vanilla move planner. These include:
    1. The bug where the most recently moved unit sometimes displays as unmoved in the move planner.
    2. The bug where already-moved units sometimes do not unwait with the "Unwait All" button.
    3. The bug where the damage calculator cannot select units that were built on the move planner page.
    4. The visual bug where capture icons are displayed for infantry that have already finished capturing.
    5. The visual bug where black boat sprites break when a savestate is uploaded.

----
My fixes:
Unit value showing up on player panel
Keeping track of power meter on setting units hp/removing units.
[Needs testing]
